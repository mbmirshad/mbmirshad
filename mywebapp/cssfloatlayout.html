        Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge represents two of Monetâ€™s greatest
        achievements: his gardens at Giverny and the paintings they inspired.
        Monet moved to Giverny in 1883 and immediately began to develop the
        property. For him, the gardens were both a passion and a second
        artistic medium. <br /><br />
      
        His Asian garden was not part of the original estate; it was
        located on an adjacent property with a small brook,
        which he purchased and enlarged into a pond for a water garden
        in 1893. He transformed the site into an inspired vision
        of cool greens and calm, reflective waters, enhanced by exotic
        plants such as bamboo, ginkgo, and Japanese fruit trees and a
        Japanese footbridge. It was not until 1899, however, that he
        began a series of views of the site, of which this is one.
